# Revenue_Insights_in_Hospitality_Domain_Dashboard using Power BI

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.



1) Identify the data sources pertaining to revenue management

2)Clean and model the data as per requirement for analysis

3)Create a revenue dashboard that measures important KPIs 

4)Relevant filters need to provided to slice and dice the data 

5)The dashboard should depict both high level and granular insights

--It’ll help the company to take strategic business decisions based on the insights from the dashboard.

--There are 5 tables provided for tracking revenue, 3 dimension tables (date, hotel, room) and 2 fact tables (bookings, aggregated bookings)

--Power BI was the tool used for creating the dashboard.

Learnt things from this Project:
